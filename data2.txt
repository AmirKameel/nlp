I love my family very much. We are a small family. 
consisting of four people, my father.
my mother, me and my sister.
We live in a beautiful house.
and each of us has a room.
My father is a teacher.
my father goes to work at  seven.
and my mother is a nurse.
and she goes to work at eight.
My sister and I go to school. 
I take care of my sister and protect her.
My grandfather was the head of the court.
while my father is a member of the Peopleâ€™s Assembly.
My mother was very tired in order to provide me with happiness,.
my mother was staying up next to me when I was sick. 
my mother taking care of me and giving me medicines at the specified time.
my mother also helped me in studying my lessons.
Family members share and discuss everything. 
They share equal parts of all the responsibilities in a family. 
In society,there is much need of a good family.
It is because the good family makes the social good.
and a good community can make a good nation.
